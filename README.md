- I’m currently learning MERN stack development through the UofU Fullstack Bootcamp!
- I am self-learning how to create 3D objects/scenes in Blender & working on a 'mini-game' to put those objects to use.
- Outside of work & school I’m interested in finding the best vegan restaurants in Utah, rollerskating, hiking, reading, hula hooping, you name it- I have a lot of hobbies.
